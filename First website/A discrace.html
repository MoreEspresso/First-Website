<h1>Christopher</h1>

<p>My name is Christopher, I have one goal and one thing that pleases me in life, gaining knowledge. Nothing pleases me more than being able to explain the why of things, why is the sky blue, why is something good? I have been constantly working to expand my knowledge of philosophy, history, politics, economics and science over the past decade.</p>

<p>I aim to live a comfortable life where I can still pursue my ultimate goal of endless knowledge aquisition. I want to live in the countryside in a large house from which I can drive over to work then come home and continue my hobbies without feeling overworked.</p>
